                Hello! I'm Ali, a web developer with a background in product management and digital marketing. I'm currently enrolled at the University of Washington completing a certificate in Full Stack Web Development, and have recieved my Associates of Business and a Certificate of Commercial Real Estate at North Seattle College.</p><br>

            <p>Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, I spend as much time giving back to my community as possible. You can expect to find me working at one of our various film festivals around town, or you might bump into me lending a helping hand at one of the countless charity runs around the Northwest region. When I'm not working or studying, I'm outside taking in the Pacific Northwest on foot. As an avid runner I've finished 6 full marathons, 13 halfs, and too races of other distances to count.</p><br>
        
            <p>As a self-proclaimed movie buff, I make it out to the theaters whenever I can. I've always found pleasure in taking the time to break down whatever piece of entertainment I've just consumed, so whether it is books or movies, it's likely I've written about it in my free time.</p>
